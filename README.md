# Saleor SDK + TypeScript + Next.js example

Used libraries:

- Saleor SDK
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

# Installation

```bash
npm i
```

# Configuration

If you want to connect to your own Saleor API or change test credentials, you can do this using [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables):

1. Create `.env.local` file.
2. Add values you would like to overwrite, based on `.env.development` file.

By default `.env.local` file is ignored to avoid exposing secrets.

# Starting dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```
